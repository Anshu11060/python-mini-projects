# 🚀 Python Mini Projects

Welcome to my collection of beginner-friendly Python projects!  
These small and very basic  but it helped me strengthen my understanding of Python fundamentals.


## 🧮 Calculator App :
A simple and fully functional calculator built using Python. This is my first project to practice my fundamentals which is why I’ve kept it basic.

**Features:**
- Basic operations: Add, Subtract, Multiply, Divide
- Error handling for invalid input

## 📇 Contact Book / Phonebook App
A terminal-based phonebook where you can:

✅ Add new contacts

Built using Python dictionaries, loops, and functions – ideal for anyone starting with CLI-based projects.
